# Webscraping_Wiki<br>
**This project's purpose is to scrape latin-alphabet information from Wikipedia**<br><br>
**The scraping content is mainly -:**<br>
**1) History of alphabet.<br>2) Writing Systems.<br>3) Usecases**<br><br>
**The entire project is automated with single click of button and entire information regarding page is at hand of user.**<br><br>
**Complete project is made using javascript using cheerio as library for scraping.**<br><br>
**I've also performed some necessary cleaning on output so that it becomes readable. I've used regex for this purpose using ecmascript.**
